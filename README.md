# PIC16F887A-UARTWITHLCD-LOGIN

1. Sample Code with UART and LCD
Observations:
The code appears to be for a PIC microcontroller interfaced with an LCD display and UART communication.
The LCD functions (type(), on(), address(), data(), display(), etc.) are well-defined for controlling the LCD.
The transmiter() function sends characters via UART, and the receiver() function receives characters from UART.
The main() function displays "ROHITH" on the LCD, transmits the same string via UART, and then receives a character and displays it on the LCD.
Suggestions:
It's a good practice to add comments to explain the purpose of each function and section of the code.
Consider handling the TXIF and RCIF flags more robustly to avoid potential issues.
Ensure that the microcontroller configurations (e.g., baud rate, data bits) match the settings of the device you are communicating with.

3. Login Using UART and LCD
Observations:
This code extends the previous one to implement a simple login system using a keypad.
It prompts the user to enter a username and password on the LCD and sends the entered characters via UART.
It compares the entered credentials and displays messages on the LCD accordingly.
Suggestions:
Similar to the first code, consider adding comments for clarity and maintainability.
The login system is hardcoded with a specific username and password. In a practical scenario, you might want to use more secure methods.


4. Login Only System Keys Without LCD
Observations:
This code implements a login system without an LCD, using only UART communication.
It prompts the user to enter a username and password and sends the credentials via UART.
The login function checks the entered credentials against a hardcoded username and password.
